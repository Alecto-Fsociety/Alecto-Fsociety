# Welcome to Alecto-Fsociety!

## Hey, welcome to Alecto-Fsociety!

I'm **Alecto**.  
Here, I focus on developing **tools** related to **cybersecurity**.  
I mainly use **Python** for development,  
working in a **Linux environment** with **Vim** as my editor (though I dabble in other languages too).  
Sometimes, I also create **Bash scripts** to automate installation processes.
